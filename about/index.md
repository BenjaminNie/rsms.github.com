My name is Benjamin Nie and the beautiful city of Vancouver is where I call home.

I'm a fourth year electrical and computer engineering student with a love for software, hardware, and all the magic in between. My interests include robotics, RESTful design, embedded devices, mobile apps, R-Pi/Arduino development, agile methodologies, quality software, and clean code. Simplicity is the ultimate beauty, God lies in the details, and VIM is a great friend.

On my leisure days, I prefer craft beers, sports, and outdoor adventures.
